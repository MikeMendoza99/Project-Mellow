# Project MELLOW

Welcome to the official repository for **Project MELLOW** â€” a cozy, chill sandbox experience built with **Unreal Engine**.

## About

Project MELLOW is an experimental avatar-based sandbox focused on relaxation, downtime, and subtle social interaction. Inspired by the idea of rest and calm, this project aims to create a welcoming environment where players can unwind, express themselves through simple but charming customization, and share quiet moments together.

The world is inhabited by unique, stylized characters known as "Blankets." While they have a whimsical origin story, the game treats them as neutral, humanoid avatars designed to foster inclusivity and creativity without overcomplicating social dynamics.

## Tech Stack

- Engine: Unreal Engine 5
- Language: C++ / Blueprint
- Target Platforms: PC (with scalable graphics settings to support a wide range of hardware)

## Current Focus

- Core gameplay loop of casual socialization and avatar interaction
- Modular cosmetic system for outfits, accessories, and cozy home items
- Lightweight performance with options to toggle visual fidelity
- Dynamic day-night cycles with calming ambient effects

## Why "Project MELLOW"?

We chose this codename to reflect the soothing, mellow vibes at the heart of this project. It's all about ease, comfort, and a welcoming space for players to rest in the virtual world.
